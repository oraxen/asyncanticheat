# Checks Overview

AsyncAnticheat modules implement various checks to detect different types of cheating. This section documents the available checks, how they work, and how to configure them.

## Check Categories

### Movement Checks

Detect speed hacks, fly hacks, and other movement-related cheats.

- [Speed](/docs/checks/movement#speed) - Horizontal movement speed violations
- [Fly](/docs/checks/movement#fly) - Unauthorized flight detection
- [NoFall](/docs/checks/movement#nofall) - Fall damage bypass
- [Phase](/docs/checks/movement#phase) - Moving through solid blocks
- [Step](/docs/checks/movement#step) - Stepping up blocks too quickly

### Combat Checks

Detect killaura, reach hacks, and other combat cheats.

- [Reach](/docs/checks/combat#reach) - Hitting from too far away
- [Killaura](/docs/checks/combat#killaura) - Automated combat detection
- [Velocity](/docs/checks/combat#velocity) - Knockback modification
- [AutoClicker](/docs/checks/combat#autoclicker) - Abnormal click patterns

### Interaction Checks

Detect scaffold, nuker, and other block interaction cheats.

- [Scaffold](/docs/checks/interaction#scaffold) - Automated bridge building
- [Nuker](/docs/checks/interaction#nuker) - Fast block breaking
- [FastPlace](/docs/checks/interaction#fastplace) - Rapid block placement
- [Inventory](/docs/checks/interaction#inventory) - Inventory manipulation cheats

## Check Naming Convention

Checks follow a hierarchical naming pattern:

```
category.type.subtype
```

Examples:
- `speed.ground` - Speed on ground
- `speed.air` - Speed while airborne
- `fly.creative` - Creative-mode fly detection
- `reach.attack` - Attack reach violation

## Severity Levels

Each finding includes a **severity** indicating its seriousness:

| Severity | Description | Typical Action |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `low` | Minor anomaly, possibly legitimate | Log only |
| `medium` | Moderate suspicion | Warn player |
| `high` | Strong indication of cheating | Kick player |
| `critical` | Definitive cheat detection | Ban player |

Modules determine severity based on the confidence and impact of the detection. Multiple low-severity findings from the same player may indicate a pattern worth investigating.

### Violation Tracking

Modules can track **violation levels (VL)** internally to accumulate evidence over time before emitting a finding. This is stored in the module's per-player state and decays between batches:

- Typical decay: 1 VL per 10 seconds
- No violations for 60 seconds: Reset to 0
- When VL crosses a threshold, a finding is emitted with the appropriate severity

## Check Feasibility

Different checks have varying effectiveness in async analysis:

### ✅ Well-Suited for Async

- Speed checks (clear packet patterns)
- Fly checks (gravity violations)
- Reach checks (distance calculations)
- Click pattern analysis

### ⚠️ Challenging for Async

- Timer checks (requires precise timing)
- Phase checks (needs world state)
- FastUse checks (item timing sensitive)

### ❌ Not Suitable for Async

- Instant checks (require server-side response)
- World-dependent checks (need block data)

## Check Configuration

Per-check configuration via module settings:

```json
{
  "checks": {
    "speed": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sensitivity": 1.0,
      "max_vl_per_batch": 100
    },
    "fly": {
      "enabled": true,
      "creative_exempt": true
    }
  }
}
```
