# Interaction Checks

Interaction checks detect scaffold, nuker, and other block/item interaction cheats.

## Scaffold

Detects automated bridge building.

### scaffold.pattern

Unnatural block placement patterns.

**Detection:**
- Track block placements while moving
- Analyze placement timing and positions
- Detect impossible placement angles

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "player_core_scaffold_pattern",
  "severity": "high",
  "title": "Scaffold: 15 placements while moving",
  "description": "Automated bridge building pattern detected",
  "evidence_json": {
    "placements_while_moving": 15,
    "average_placement_interval_ms": 45,
    "look_direction_changes": 0
  }
}
```

### scaffold.angle

Placing blocks at impossible angles.

**Detection:**
- Compare player look direction to block placement
- Track cursor position on placed block
- Flag placements without proper aim

### scaffold.timing

Perfect placement timing detection.

**Detection:**
- Analyze interval between placements
- Detect inhuman consistency
- Compare to server tick timing

## Nuker

Detects fast block breaking.

### nuker.speed

Breaking blocks too quickly.

**Detection:**
- Track time between dig start and complete
- Compare to block break time with tool
- Flag instant or near-instant breaks

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "player_core_nuker_speed",
  "severity": "critical",
  "title": "Nuker: 50ms break time (expected 750ms)",
  "description": "Block broken significantly faster than possible",
  "evidence_json": {
    "break_time_ms": 50,
    "expected_time_ms": 750,
    "block_type": "stone",
    "tool": "diamond_pickaxe"
  }
}
```

### nuker.pattern

Breaking multiple blocks impossibly fast.

**Detection:**
- Track break locations and timing
- Detect multi-block breaks in single tick
- Flag impossible break patterns

## FastPlace

Detects rapid block placement.

### fastplace.rate

Placing blocks faster than allowed.

**Detection:**
- Count placements per time window
- Maximum vanilla is ~4 blocks/tick
- Flag excessive placement rates

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "player_advanced_fastplace_rate",
  "severity": "medium",
  "title": "FastPlace: 25 blocks/sec",
  "description": "Block placement rate exceeds maximum allowed",
  "evidence_json": {
    "placements_per_second": 25,
    "max_allowed": 20
  }
}
```

## Inventory

Detects inventory manipulation cheats.

### inventory.instant

Instant inventory interactions.

**Detection:**
- Track time between inventory open and clicks
- Detect superhuman click speeds
- Flag instant item transfers

### inventory.pattern

Unnatural inventory click patterns.

**Detection:**
- Analyze click sequences
- Detect automated sorting patterns
- Flag impossible click combinations

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "player_advanced_inventory_pattern",
  "severity": "high",
  "title": "Inventory: 35 CPS across 20 slots",
  "description": "Unnatural inventory click pattern detected",
  "evidence_json": {
    "clicks_per_second": 35,
    "unique_slots_clicked": 20,
    "time_window_ms": 100
  }
}
```

### inventory.steal

Chest stealing detection.

**Detection:**
- Track container interactions
- Detect instant chest emptying
- Flag superhuman transfer speeds

## Timer

Detects game speed modification.

### timer.speed

Game running faster than normal.

**Detection:**
- Compare packet rate to expected rate
- Track packet timestamps
- Flag accelerated game speed

**Note:** Timer detection is challenging in async mode due to network jitter. Best results come from analyzing patterns over longer periods.

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "movement_advanced_timer_speed",
  "severity": "high",
  "title": "Timer: 1.25x speed",
  "description": "Game running faster than normal tick rate",
  "evidence_json": {
    "packets_per_second": 25,
    "expected": 20,
    "speed_multiplier": 1.25
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Example interaction check configuration:

```json
{
  "interaction": {
    "scaffold": {
      "enabled": true,
      "min_placements_for_detection": 5,
      "max_placement_speed": 50
    },
    "nuker": {
      "enabled": true,
      "instant_break_threshold_ms": 100
    },
    "fastplace": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_placements_per_second": 20
    },
    "inventory": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_clicks_per_second": 30,
      "min_interaction_delay_ms": 50
    },
    "timer": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_speed_multiplier": 1.05,
      "sample_window_seconds": 10
    }
  }
}
```

## Limitations

### World State Dependency

Many interaction checks benefit from world state:

- Block break times depend on block type and tool
- Placement validity requires knowing adjacent blocks
- Some cheats only detectable with server-side info

**Workaround:** Include block type hints in packet data when available.

### Async Timing Challenges

Interaction timing is affected by:

- Network latency variations
- Packet batching delays
- Clock skew between client and server

Use statistical analysis over time windows rather than single-event detection.
