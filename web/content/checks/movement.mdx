# Movement Checks

Movement checks detect speed hacks, fly hacks, and other movement-related cheats.

## Speed

Detects players moving faster than allowed.

### speed.ground

Horizontal speed while on the ground.

**Detection:**
- Compare distance traveled between position packets
- Account for sprint, effects, and modifiers
- Flag when exceeding maximum legitimate speed

**Vanilla Limits:**
| Movement Type | Max Speed (blocks/tick) |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Walking | 0.1 |
| Sprinting | 0.26 |
| Sprint + Speed II | 0.52 |

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "movement_core_speed_ground",
  "severity": "high",
  "title": "Ground speed: 0.85 b/tick",
  "description": "Moving faster than max allowed speed on ground",
  "evidence_json": {
    "distance": 0.85,
    "max_allowed": 0.52,
    "has_speed_effect": true,
    "is_sprinting": true
  }
}
```

### speed.air

Horizontal speed while airborne.

**Detection:**
- Track horizontal movement during jumps
- Account for initial velocity and momentum
- Detect acceleration that violates physics

### speed.vehicle

Speed while riding entities (horses, boats, etc.).

**Detection:**
- Compare vehicle movement packets
- Account for vehicle type and attributes
- Flag impossible vehicle speeds

## Fly

Detects unauthorized flight.

### fly.survival

Flying in survival/adventure mode.

**Detection:**
- Track vertical position over time
- Identify sustained altitude without falling
- Detect creative-style flight patterns

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "movement_core_fly_survival",
  "severity": "critical",
  "title": "Survival flight: 120 ticks airborne",
  "description": "Sustained flight detected without elytra or creative mode",
  "evidence_json": {
    "airtime_ticks": 120,
    "average_y_delta": 0.001,
    "expected": "falling"
  }
}
```

### fly.hover

Hovering in place while airborne.

**Detection:**
- Identify packets with minimal Y movement
- Account for cobweb, water, and other blocks
- Flag sustained hovering patterns

### fly.glide

Gliding without elytra or riptide.

**Detection:**
- Track fall rate over time
- Compare to expected gravity
- Detect artificially slow falling

## NoFall

Detects fall damage bypass.

### nofall.ground

Spoofing on_ground flag to avoid damage.

**Detection:**
- Compare claimed on_ground with expected state
- Track fall distance and landing
- Flag ground claims during falls

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "movement_core_nofall_ground",
  "severity": "high",
  "title": "NoFall: 15.5 block fall without damage",
  "description": "Player claimed on_ground during significant fall",
  "evidence_json": {
    "claimed_ground": true,
    "fall_distance": 15.5,
    "y_position": 64.0
  }
}
```

## Phase

Detects moving through solid blocks.

### phase.horizontal

Moving through walls horizontally.

**Detection:**
- Track position changes through solid blocks
- Requires world state (challenging async)
- Best used with block position hints

### phase.vertical

Moving through floors/ceilings.

**Detection:**
- Track vertical position through solid blocks
- Flag impossible upward movement
- Detect floor clipping

## Step

Detects stepping up blocks too quickly.

### step.height

Stepping up more than allowed.

**Detection:**
- Track Y increases per movement
- Maximum vanilla step is 0.5 blocks
- Flag larger single-tick Y increases

**Example Finding:**
```json
{
  "detector_name": "movement_advanced_step_height",
  "severity": "medium",
  "title": "Step height: 1.5 blocks",
  "description": "Stepped up more than maximum allowed height",
  "evidence_json": {
    "step_height": 1.5,
    "max_allowed": 0.6,
    "on_ground_before": true
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Example movement check configuration:

```json
{
  "movement": {
    "speed": {
      "enabled": true,
      "buffer": 0.05,
      "sprint_multiplier": 1.3,
      "effect_consideration": true
    },
    "fly": {
      "enabled": true,
      "max_airtime_ticks": 80,
      "hover_threshold": 0.01
    },
    "nofall": {
      "enabled": true,
      "min_fall_distance": 3.0
    }
  }
}
```
