# Dashboard Overview

The AsyncAnticheat dashboard provides real-time visibility into cheat detection on your Minecraft server.

![Dashboard Overview](/docs/dashboard-overview.webp)

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Go to [asyncanticheat.com/dashboard](https://asyncanticheat.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in with your account
3. Select your server from the dropdown

## Main Components

### Global Monitor

The central visualization shows your server's activity in real-time:

- **Player positions** appear as dots on the radar
- **Active findings** pulse to draw attention
- **LIVE indicator** confirms real-time data flow

### Stats Panel

Quick metrics at the bottom:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Detections** | Total findings, with today's count highlighted |
| **Modules** | Number of active detection modules |
| **Players** | Players with at least one finding |
| **Latency** | Round-trip time to the API |

### Recent Findings

The right panel shows the latest detections:

- Click any finding to see player details
- **View all →** opens the full Findings page

### Connection Status

Monitor your infrastructure health:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Dashboard → API** | Latency from your browser to our API |
| **API → Server** | TCP ping from API to your Minecraft server (optional) |
| **Plugin Status** | Time since last data from your plugin |

#### How Plugin Status Works

The plugin sends data to the API whenever there's activity. The "Plugin Status" shows how long ago the last data was received. A plugin is considered **online** if data was received within the last 2 hours.

> **Note:** If your server has no players, the plugin may only send keep-alive pings infrequently. This is normal—the plugin batches packets and only uploads when there's meaningful data.

#### API → Server Ping

The "API → Server" connection status shows TCP ping results from our API to your Minecraft server (default port 25565).

**Automatic Detection**: The server address is automatically detected from your plugin's IP address when it connects to the API. This happens automatically—no configuration needed for most setups.

**Manual Override**: If auto-detection doesn't work (e.g., your server is behind NAT or uses a different public address), you can set the address explicitly in your plugin's `config.yml`:

```yaml
api:
  url: https://api.asyncanticheat.com
  token: your-token-here
  server_address: play.yourserver.com:25565  # Optional override
```

The priority order is:
1. Explicit `server_address` in config (if set)
2. Auto-detected from plugin's connection IP

If no address is configured or detected, this metric is hidden and doesn't affect your overall status.


## Navigation

Use the sidebar to access different sections:

- **Overview** - Main dashboard (this page)
- **[Players](/docs/dashboard/players)** - View player sessions and history
- **[Findings](/docs/dashboard/findings)** - Browse all detections
- **[Modules](/docs/dashboard/modules)** - Configure detection modules
- **[Settings](/docs/dashboard/settings)** - Server configuration

## Server Selector

If you have multiple servers, use the dropdown at the top of the sidebar to switch between them.

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard automatically refreshes data every few seconds. You don't need to manually refresh the page to see new findings or player activity.
