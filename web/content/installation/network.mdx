# Network Setup

How to install AsyncAnticheat on BungeeCord and Velocity networks.

## Important

AsyncAnticheat does **not** support proxy-only installation. You must install the plugin on **each backend server** individually.

## Why install on backend servers?

- **Full packet visibility**: Backend servers have access to all game packets, including position, combat, and interaction data
- **Server-side context**: The plugin can access server-side player state (swimming, flying, game mode, etc.) which is essential for accurate detection
- **Folia compatibility**: Backend Paper/Folia servers are fully supported

## Installation Steps

1. **Download** the plugin from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/oraxen/asyncanticheat/releases/latest/download/async-anticheat.jar)
2. **Install on each backend server** (e.g., Survival, SkyBlock, Factions, etc.)
3. **Link each server** to your dashboard using the console link
4. Each server will appear as a **separate server** in the dashboard

## Per-Server Configuration

Each backend server can have its own configuration to match its specific needs:

```yaml
# Example: Creative server with relaxed detection
capture:
  sample_rate: 0.5  # Only capture 50% of packets

# Example: Competitive PvP server with full capture
capture:
  sample_rate: 1.0  # Capture all packets
```

### Configuration Examples

| Server Type | Recommended Sample Rate | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------|
| PvP / Competitive | 1.0 (100%) | Full detection accuracy |
| Survival / SMP | 1.0 (100%) | Standard configuration |
| Creative | 0.5 (50%) | Less critical, save bandwidth |
| Minigames | 1.0 (100%) | Important for fairness |

## Dashboard View

In the dashboard, each backend server appears separately:

- **Thomas' Survival**
- **Thomas' SkyBlock**
- **Thomas' Factions**

You can switch between servers using the dropdown in the sidebar.

## Cross-Server Detection

Even though each server is linked separately, the AsyncAnticheat API can:

- Track players across your entire network
- Detect ban evaders using different accounts
- Correlate patterns across servers
